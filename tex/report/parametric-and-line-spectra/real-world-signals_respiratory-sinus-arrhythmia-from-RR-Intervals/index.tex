\section{Real World Signals: Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia from RR-Intervals}

The standard and averaged periodograms with different window lengths $L \in \{ 50, 100, 200 \}$ are obtained and illustrated in figure \ref{fig:2_4_a}.
In detail, Bartlett's method periodogram is used, where:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item the signal is split to $M$ non-overlapping segments of length $L$
    \item the standard periodogram (rectangular window) of each segment is calculated
    \item the $M$ periodograms are averaged
\end{enumerate}

Increasing $M$ (or decreasing $L$) trades frequency resolution for variance, which is reflected in \ref{fig:2_4_a},
where the standard periodogram, which can be treated as a special case of the Bartlett's method with $M = 1$, has finest frequency resolution but largest variance,
while for $L = 50$ and $M \rightarrow \mathtt{max}$, variance is minimised in price of larger frequency resolution.

The three trials were carried out under different breathing conditions, which is reflected by the Breaths per Minute (BPM) rate.
Table \ref{tab:2_4_b} summarises the conditions and the corresponding expected and observed BPM measurements for each trial.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|}
\hline
& \textbf{Conditions} & \textbf{Expected Range} (BPM) & \textbf{Observation} (BPM) \\
\hline
\hline
\textbf{Trial 1} & normal \& unconstraint breathing & $12 - 35$ & $19.69$ \\
\hline
\textbf{Trial 2} & fast breathing & $35 - 50$ & $49.92$ \\
\hline
\textbf{Trial 3} & slow breathing & $8 - 15$ & $15$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{RRI: conditions and observed BPM.}

\end{table}

The observed peaks for the three trials are at frequencies $f_{1} = 0.1641\ Hz$, $f_{2} = 0.416\ Hz$ and $f_{3} = 0.125\ Hz$.
For trial 1, both the standard and the averaged periodograms have a peak at $f_{1} = 0.1641\ Hz$, however the averaged periodograms due to their inadequate frequency resolution
fail to capture its harmonics, which are hardly visible also at the standard periodogram. Trial 2 peak at $f_{2} = 0.416\ Hz$ and its second and third harmonics are visible
using any of the provided methods. Lastly, trial 3 peak at $f_{3} = 0.125\ Hz$ and its harmonics are clearly captures by both the standard and the averaged periodograms.

The power spectral density of the three trials is estimated by fitting $p$ order AR processes and figures \ref{fig:2_4_c_1}, \ref{fig:2_4_c_2} and \ref{fig:2_4_c_3} are obtained.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{report/parametric-and-line-spectra/real-world-signals_respiratory-sinus-arrhythmia-from-RR-Intervals/assets/c/standard_ar-trial1}
    \caption{RRI Trial 1: AR process spectral estimation.}
    \label{fig:2_4_c_1}
\end{figure}

For trial 1, for $p \geq 11$, the fundamental frequency $f_{1} = 0.1641\ Hz$ and its 3 first harmonics are identified, corraborating with the results of the previous part.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{report/parametric-and-line-spectra/real-world-signals_respiratory-sinus-arrhythmia-from-RR-Intervals/assets/c/standard_ar-trial2}
    \caption{RRI Trial 2: AR process spectral estimation.}
    \label{fig:2_4_c_2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:2_4_c_2} depicts the AR spectral estimate of trial 2, which again for $p \geq 11$ adequately captures the fundamental frequency and its first three harmonics.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{report/parametric-and-line-spectra/real-world-signals_respiratory-sinus-arrhythmia-from-RR-Intervals/assets/c/standard_ar-trial3}
    \caption{RRI Trial 3: AR process spectral estimation.}
    \label{fig:2_4_c_3}
\end{figure}

Last but not least, for $p \geq 16$ trial 3 AR(p) process model discriminated all six first harmonics, verifying the respiration rate reported in the previous part.

Overall, the AR process models can provide reliable estimates when the generative process order $p$ is known, or noise power is negligible compared to the signal power.
When under-modelling is performed ($p < p_{true}$) the estimates cannot identify the frequency peaks, while in presence of noise, over-modelling ($p > p_{true}$) can
lead to overfitting noise and thus providing faulty peaks. Nonetheless, compared to the standard and averaged periodogram methods, the variance, frequency resolution trade-off
is not present in case of AR models.
